## Overview

Pneumonia is a serious respiratory condition that can be detected using chest X-rays. This project applies **deep learning** to automate the classification of chest X-rays into two categories:
1. **Normal** 
2. **Pneumonia**

By leveraging **transfer learning** with the **VGG16 model**, this approach achieves high accuracy while minimizing training time.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains chest X-ray images categorized into:
- **Training Set**: 5,216 images
- **Test Set**: 624 images

## Model Architecture

The project uses the **VGG16** model pre-trained on ImageNet as the base. The top layers are replaced with:
1. **Flatten Layer**
2. **Dense Layer (64 neurons, ReLU activation)**
3. **Dense Layer (32 neurons, ReLU activation)**
4. **Output Layer (2 neurons, Softmax activation)**

The VGG16 layers are frozen to utilize the pre-trained features while training only the added layers.

---

## Preprocessing

### **Data Augmentation**
- Rescaling pixel values to [0, 1]
- Random shear transformations
- Random zoom
- Horizontal flipping

### **Input Size**
- Images are resized to **224x224x3** to match the VGG16 input requirement.

---

## Training

The model is compiled with:
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Metrics**: Accuracy

### **Training Parameters**
- **Batch Size**: 10
- **Epochs**: 1 (for demonstration purposes, can be increased for better results)
- **Steps Per Epoch**: Number of training batches
- **Validation Steps**: Number of test batches

---

## Evaluation

### **Performance Metrics**
After 1 epoch:
- **Training Accuracy**: ~89.61%
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~88.30%
- **Validation Loss**: 0.2961

## Results

The model predicts whether the person is affected by pneumonia or not based on chest X-ray images. For example:
- Input: X-ray image
- Output: `Result is Normal` or `Person is Affected By PNEUMONIA`
